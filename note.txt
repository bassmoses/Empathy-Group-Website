Note: This code is just an example and not a complete implementation of a secure sign up form.
 Additional security measures like input validation, email verification, and password strength 
 requirements should also be implemented.



THIS ONE IS FOR EMAIL verification

 Note that this is just an example and you may need to modify the code to fit your specific needs. 
 Additionally, you may want to add additional security measures, such as using SSL/TLS for email 
 communication and using a time-limited verification code to prevent replay attacks.
